Song Feng is a scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. In general, he is interested in studying complex systems by integrating both mechanism-based and data-driven approaches, in order to understand their dynamics and evolution. The ultimate goal is to understand (some of) the design principles of complex systems, whether it is physical, biological, or social systems. Such design principles will guide the *de novo* design or systematic control of these complex systems.

The non-triviality for humans is exploring and expanding their physical and spiritual boundaries. It is an endless game. Let's have fun.
